At last the Dribbble API is here!

This is an AS3 library for Dribbble that is built using StarRequests.

DISCLAIMER:

This library uses the first draft of the Dribbble API (http://www.dribbble.com/api).
As the API is updated this library will also be maintained, but bear with me as the API is frequently changing in these early stages.

TODO:

* Add ASDoc comments
* Create examples
